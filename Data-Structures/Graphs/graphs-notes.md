# Graphs

- Graphs have vertexes (i.e. also called Node) and edges (i.e. also called as Connection).
- Any vertex is connected to another vertex by an edge. A vertex can be connected to any number of vertexes.
- Each edge can carry a specific weight.
- Connection between vertexes can be bi-directional or uni-directional.
- Typically Trees, LinkedList and few other data structures can also be classified as graphs.
- Graphs can be represents as Adjacency Matrix or Adjacency List.
- Adjacency List
